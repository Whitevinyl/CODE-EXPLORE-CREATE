WORKSHOP // Creative-Coding : Building Musical Worlds


A workshop in creative-coding, building a musical ecosystem in which autonomous organisms roam, breed and feed, generating sound with their actions.
The session will make use of Javascript, HTML5 canvas and the Web Audio API. Students should have a basic understanding of Javascript, or have completed the first 2 CodeBar JS tutorials.


*This was originally created as part of 2 days of workshops organised by CodeBar for the Brighton Digital festival.
